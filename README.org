* ColorNote backup decryptor 
  This is a simple tool to decrypt a color note backup archive.

  [[https://www.colornote.com/][ColorNote]] (shookingly..) don't support any kind of export[1] and the backup format is both proprietary and encrypted using a undocumented method.

  This tool will decrypt your auto backup (passwd: 0000) files to json format.

  I've included a prebuild jar for convenience.

  Let me know if you need help getting it to work. This was thrown together for my own need and is not polished and user friendly. It's only tested on very old backup file.

*** Usage
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell-script
    java -jar *-AUTO.dat | fixup > notes.json
    # Optional
    jq --raw-output '[.created_date, .modified_date, .title, .note] | @csv' < notes.json > notes.cvs
    #+END_SRC
